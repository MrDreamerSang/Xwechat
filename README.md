Press the direction key 'Up'/'Down'/'Right'/'Left'  ->  choose a friend/group to start the chats

Press 'Enter'  ->  switch to the chat screen like the picture 1 above. It will generate two screens, the top one will display the messages you sent to or received from the friend/group you have chosen; the bottom one will wait for your inputs and send the message to the chosen friend/group

## Tips for the chats
1. How to delete/rewrite messages you have typed?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While you are typing messages, if you want to delete/rewrite the messages, just press the DELETE key and then press Enter, it will then ask you to re-type messages

2. How to exit the chat page and list your friends/groups/contacts?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you didn't type anything yet, then just press Enter, it wil then go back to the friends list page as well.
